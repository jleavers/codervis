# codervis

A local web dashboard that shows your **Claude Code** and **Codex CLI** quota
usage live, displayed as geiger-style meters that shift from **lime → amber →
coral** as you approach the limit.

## How it works

Each coding agent stores a credential locally that its own usage endpoint
accepts. codervis reads each one and polls the matching undocumented endpoint:

| Agent | Credential (read-only) | Endpoint(s) | Windows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/.credentials.json` → `claudeAiOauth.accessToken` (bearer) | `GET claude.ai/api/oauth/usage` | 5-hour + all-model weekly + Fable weekly utilization |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/auth.json` → `tokens.access_token` + `account_id` (bearer) | `GET chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` | 5-hour + weekly utilization |

Claude and Codex return utilization as a percentage plus a reset timestamp.

codervis runs as a small FastAPI container, **bind-mounts both data
directories read-only**, reads the tokens, and polls the endpoints. The browser
gets live updates via Server-Sent Events; CSS animates the meter fill and the
colour shifts as the percentage rises.

**Outbound traffic is allow-listed.** The dashboard's container sits on an
internal Docker network with no route off the host. Its only way out is the
`egress` service, a CONNECT-only proxy that admits `claude.ai` and
`chatgpt.com` and nothing else. A redirect, a host override or a compromised
dependency therefore cannot carry a token anywhere else, and plain `http://` is
refused outright. Docker cannot publish a port from an internal-only container,
so the port you open in the browser belongs to `ingress`, a relay that forwards
to the dashboard. Neither gateway service holds a credential.

Each provider header has a browser-local toggle. Switching a widget off keeps
its card visible but dimmed, labels it `disabled`, and removes it from the
overall status summary. Choices are stored in browser `localStorage`, survive
container restarts, and do not affect other browsers.

If a live endpoint is unreachable for any reason (expired token, network
down, or the vendor changes the API), that panel renders an "unavailable"
state. codervis does not estimate quota usage from local transcripts; it only
reads timestamp/metadata to show each agent's local last activity.

### Caveats

- Both live endpoints are **internal**, not part of the vendors' public APIs.
  They can change or disappear at any time.
- The dashboard reads the credential each tool maintains. It does
  **not** implement OAuth flows of its own — you need Claude Code and/or Codex
  CLI installed and signed in on the host machine.
- **Codex quota windows can move between primary and secondary slots.** Codervis
  classifies 5-hour and weekly windows from their reported duration, then falls
  back to the legacy primary/secondary ordering when duration metadata is
  absent. A lone durationless `primary_window` remains weekly for compatibility
  with the earlier weekly-only response. If either window is omitted, its gauge
  reads “—” while the other remains live.
- **Claude's Fable limit is plan-dependent.** Codervis reads the
  `weekly_scoped` Fable entry from the endpoint's `limits` list. If Anthropic
  omits that optional entry or returns it malformed, the Fable gauge shows “—”
  while the 5-hour and all-model weekly gauges remain live.
- Claude Code refreshes its own access token. If you have not opened Claude
  Code for a while, Anthropic may return `HTTP 401` to codervis until the host
  CLI runs and refreshes `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. Open Claude Code from a
  terminal on the host, then wait for the next dashboard refresh.
- Read-only bind mounts: codervis never writes to `~/.claude` or `~/.codex`.
- The `*_ENABLED` variables only choose the initial toggle state for a browser
  with no saved preference. All provider clients are still constructed and
  polled, so these variables do not suppress credential reads or upstream
  calls.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (or any recent Docker + Compose v2)
- Either or both of, installed and signed in on the host:
  - Claude Code (so `~/.claude/.credentials.json` exists)
  - Codex CLI (so `~/.codex/auth.json` exists)

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

| Variable | What it does | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLAUDE_HOME` | Host path to your Claude Code data dir. **On Windows set this explicitly** — e.g. `C:/Users/you/.claude`. | `~/.claude` |
| `CODEX_HOME` | Host path to your Codex CLI data dir. Same Windows caveat. | `~/.codex` |
| `CLAUDE_ENABLED` | First-visit browser widget default. | `true` |
| `CODEX_ENABLED` | First-visit browser widget default. | `true` |
| `DASHBOARD_PORT` | Host port the dashboard listens on. | `8765` |
| `REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | How often the browser is pushed a fresh snapshot. | `5` |
| `QUOTA_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Server-side cache for the upstream calls. Keep ≥ refresh interval. | `30` |
| `CLAUDE_ACTIVITY_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Server-side cache for Claude local transcript timestamp scans. | `5` |
| `CODEX_ACTIVITY_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Server-side cache for Codex local activity metadata scans. | `5` |
| `CLAUDE_AI_HOST` | Override the Claude host (rarely needed). Must be `https://`; add the host to `EGRESS_ALLOW`. | `https://claude.ai` |
| `CHATGPT_HOST` | Override the Codex host (rarely needed). Must be `https://`; add the host to `EGRESS_ALLOW`. | `https://chatgpt.com` |
| `EGRESS_ALLOW` | Extra hosts the egress proxy admits, comma- or space-separated. `host` means port 443, `host:port` names another, and `.example.com` admits the domain and everything under it. It extends the built-in `claude.ai` and `chatgpt.com`; it never replaces them. | empty |

### Windows note

Docker Compose on Windows does **not** expand `~` in bind-mount paths, so
the home-directory defaults only work if you set the paths explicitly. The
simplest thing is:

```dotenv
CLAUDE_HOME=C:/Users/yourname/.claude
CODEX_HOME=C:/Users/yourname/.codex
```

(Forward slashes work fine inside `.env`.)

If you don't use an agent, point its `*_HOME` at an existing directory and set
its `*_ENABLED=false` to make the widget initially dimmed. This is only a
browser presentation default; the app still checks the provider credential
path and polls any configured live client.

## Run

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Open <http://localhost:8765> (or whichever port you set). The default Compose
port mapping also exposes the dashboard on your LAN at
`http://<your-host-ip>:8765`.

To confirm the egress bound from inside the dashboard's container:

```bash
docker compose exec codervis python -m app.egress check
```

```text
[ OK ] http://egress:3128 refused egress-probe.invalid (403)
[ OK ] CLAUDE_AI_HOST: claude.ai:443 admitted
[ OK ] CHATGPT_HOST: chatgpt.com:443 admitted
[ OK ] example.com:443 unreachable directly: no route round the proxy
```

The admission probes open a TCP connection to each host through the proxy and
send nothing. To change the allow-list, edit `EGRESS_ALLOW` in `.env` and run
`docker compose up -d egress`.

To stop:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Test

Install development dependencies, then run the suite:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest
python -m py_compile app/main.py app/quota.py app/claude_activity.py app/codex_quota.py app/codex_activity.py app/egress.py app/ingress.py
```

The tests use temporary directories and stubbed upstream clients. They do not
read your real credential files and do not call the live quota endpoints. The
proxy and relay tests use loopback sockets only.
`tests/test_compose_topology.py` renders `docker-compose.yml` with
`docker compose config`, which needs the Docker CLI but no daemon. It is skipped
where Docker is not installed.

## What you see

One panel per agent (Claude Code, Codex):

- **Claude** shows **5-Hour Window**, **Weekly Window**, and **Weekly Window
  (Fable)** gauges, each with a countdown when its reset time is available.
- **Codex** shows **5-Hour Window** and **Weekly Window** gauges with their reset
  countdowns. If Codex omits either window, that gauge reads “—”.
- Per-panel header shows the server source state (`live` / `unavailable`) or
  the browser-local presentation state (`disabled`); footer shows the plan
  and most recent local activity. Claude activity comes from project
  transcript timestamps; Codex from local history/session file metadata. When a
  live quota call fails the footer shows one of a fixed set of messages
  (`app/degrade.py`): the dashboard never echoes an exception's own text,
  because that text can carry the stored token.

The fill colour is computed from the percentage: lime under 50%, sliding
through amber, to coral as you approach 100%. Unavailable gauges and
browser-disabled cards are dimmed.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
| --- | --- |
| Chip shows `unavailable` with `upstream rejected the stored credential` | The agent's access token has expired and the host CLI has not refreshed it yet. Open Claude Code (or Codex) from a terminal on the host, then wait for the next dashboard refresh. |
| Chip shows `unavailable` with `stored credential unavailable or unusable` | `~/.claude/.credentials.json` or `~/.codex/auth.json` is missing, unreadable inside the container, not JSON, or has no access token. A token containing a newline is also refused, because it cannot be sent as an HTTP header. |
| Chip shows `unavailable` with `upstream unreachable` | The upstream host could not be reached: no route out, the `egress` proxy refused the host name, a DNS failure, or a dropped connection. `docker compose logs egress` names a host it refused. |
| Chip shows `unavailable` with `upstream returned an error response` | The endpoint answered with a status other than 200 — including `405` when a `CLAUDE_AI_HOST`/`CHATGPT_HOST` override uses `http://`, since egress is HTTPS only. |
| Chip shows `unavailable` with `upstream response not understood` | The undocumented endpoint changed shape, or returned a value the payload schema refuses (a percentage that is not a finite number in 0–100, for instance). |
| Chip shows `unavailable` with `internal error` | A bug in the dashboard rather than in the credential or the endpoint. Please report it. |
| `claude_credentials_present: false` from `/healthz` | Bind mount didn't pick up the credentials file. Verify `CLAUDE_HOME` points at your real `.claude` directory. |
| `codex_credentials_present: false` from `/healthz` | Same, for `CODEX_HOME` / `~/.codex/auth.json`. |
| Browser shows `reconnecting…` | The container restarted; SSE will reconnect on its own. |
| Every chip reads `unavailable` and `docker compose logs egress` shows a refused host | The host is not on the egress allow-list: a `CLAUDE_AI_HOST`/`CHATGPT_HOST` override without a matching `EGRESS_ALLOW` entry, or the vendor redirected to another host. |
| `docker compose up` reports `dependency failed to start` | The `egress` proxy is unhealthy, and the dashboard waits for it. Check `docker compose logs egress`. |

`/healthz` returns JSON with `data_root_exists` and `credentials_present`
flags that are useful for quick diagnosis.

## Security notes

- `~/.claude/.credentials.json` and `~/.codex/auth.json` both contain
  long-lived session tokens. Both bind mounts are read-only. The default
  Compose port mapping publishes the dashboard on all host interfaces,
  so machines on your LAN can reach it at `http://<your-host-ip>:8765`.
  **Don't expose this port to the public internet** — anyone who can
  reach it can read your usage. If you need remote access, put it behind
  a reverse proxy with auth.
- Outbound traffic from the dashboard's container can only reach the hosts on
  the egress allow-list, and only over HTTPS. The proxy sees host names, never
  the TLS session or the tokens inside it. This bounds where a token can be
  sent; it does not change who can reach the published port.
- Whoever can reach the port is bounded in what they can cost: `ingress` holds
  at most 256 connections, and it drops a client that has not sent a complete
  request within 10 seconds. Every service's log is capped at 3 × 10 MB.
- The dashboard never logs the tokens. If you regenerated `usage-debug.log`
  during setup, delete it.
